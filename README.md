# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.


## Running on production
According to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/5pien9/iptables_vs_nginx_for_port_forwarding_and_load/dcrzfb3/) article it is best to proxy all incoming 80/443 requests to the middleware using nginx. An nginx server can be found in the [infrastructure](https://github.com/Scholar-6/infrastructure) repository.
