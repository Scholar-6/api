# Swagger generated server
Scholar6 API swagger definition and a server that runs the dynamic documentation.

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.

open http://localhost:8080/brick to get all bricks
open http://localhost:8080/brick/:id to get brick by id
open http://localhost:8080/brick/:id/question/:id to get question by brick id and question id
